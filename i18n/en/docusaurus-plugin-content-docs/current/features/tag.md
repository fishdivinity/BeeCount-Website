- **Travel** - All expenses during a trip
- **Project** - Expenses related to a specific project
- **Gift** - Giving or receiving gifts

## Create a Tag

1. Go to "Me" → "Data Management" → "Tag Management"
2. Tap "+" to create a new tag
3. Enter a name and select a color

## Using Tags

When recording, tap "Add Tag" to select one or more tags.

## Tag Statistics

Tap a tag to view:

- Number of associated transactions
- Total amount
- Transaction list
