# FAQ

## Data Related

### Q: How do I backup my data?

There are several ways:

1. **Cloud Sync** (Recommended) - Enable iCloud/Supabase/WebDAV/S3 sync
2. **Export CSV** - Export transaction data locally
3. **Export Config** - Export categories, accounts, and other settings

### Q: How do I migrate data to a new phone?

- **iOS → iOS**: Use iCloud sync, sign in with the same Apple ID on the new device
- **Android → Android**: Use Supabase/WebDAV/S3 sync
- **Cross-platform**: Use Supabase/WebDAV/S3 sync, or export CSV and import

### Q: Where is my data stored?

Data is stored locally on your device by default. When cloud sync is enabled, it syncs to your chosen cloud service (iCloud/Supabase/WebDAV/S3). BeeCount does not collect any data.
