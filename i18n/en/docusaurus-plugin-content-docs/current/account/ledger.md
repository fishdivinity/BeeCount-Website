## Use Cases

- **Daily Ledger** - Personal daily income and expenses
- **Travel Ledger** - Expenses for a specific trip
- **Project Ledger** - Project expense tracking
- **Family Ledger** - Shared household expenses
- **Side Business Ledger** - Keep side income separate

## Create a Ledger

1. Go to "Discover" page, tap the ledger icon in the top right to enter "Ledger Management"
2. Tap "+" to create a ledger
3. Enter ledger name
4. Optionally select an icon

## Switch Ledgers

Tap a ledger to switch. The home page displays data for the current ledger.

## Ledger Independence

Each ledger's data is completely independent:

- Transaction records
- Statistics
- Categories can be shared or independent

## Delete a Ledger

Deleting a ledger also deletes all transactions in that ledger. Please proceed with caution.

We recommend exporting data as a backup first.
